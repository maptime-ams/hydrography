# Finding your way at sea

When we get in our car, on our bicycle or walk on the street, we see buildings, bridges, signs, trees, landmarks and more. All these visual references tell us where we are and where to go. But on the water.. there is nothing!

How do you find your way at sea? How do we navigate? Are there maps of the sea and how would that look like?
